# Boavizta Hackathon 24th March, 2024

# Presentation
The purpose proposed in this hackathon is to produce a standardized report to an open data repository, in the context of a machine learning task. Here, the task is the training of an image classifier, based on different choices of algorithms and hyperparameters.

# Launch the notebook
To launch directly the jupyter notebook, please type the following command.
```
jupyter notebook hackathon.ipynb
```

# Dependencies - CodeCarbon
The standardized format aims at being independent from the energy monitoring library. In the particular context of the Hackathon, though, the latest version of CodeCarbon at the date of the present commit (2.4.2) is proposed. Feel free to change this library if needed, along with the subsequent code.
