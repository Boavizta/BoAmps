Polymorphism refers to having multiple forms or types for something, that is, one thing can have more than one form. Overloading refers to using different implementations of a function based on its arguments. In C++, you can define a single function with many different meanings by accepting different parameter lists (different sets of parameters). This allows you to write code that works regardless of what type an object actually has. For example, suppose you want to print out all the elements of some container.

The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from laptop to iPad, the website automatically adjusts to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website gets bigger or smaller depending on the device it is being displayed on. A key aspect of this approach is with media queries: a way of letting style sheets adapt according to different display sizes.
