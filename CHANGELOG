# BoAMPS

##  Datamodel v1.0.0

### Major questions
- algorithm: not a list, only one algorithm at one time ? maybe not often an AI passes through many small AI ? Where do we put the name of an LLM ?

### Major Changes
- algorithm:
    - add of new fields to be able to describe better, deeplearning and llm models, add of algorithmUri, parametersNumber, layersNumber, epochsNumber, optimizer, should we remove hyperparameters ? very precise and hard to flatten
- dataset:
    - really need to be a list of you want to describe a training on multimodal data for example ?
    - separate dataset for training/ inference & inference ? In inference we can have different input & output types: e.g. you input 1 image and as a result you have few tokens like a category, nedeed because it is not at all the same order of magnitude for the 2 use cases, is it possible to describe rag ?
    - if the taskstage is inference directly show only the necessary fields
    - as a result, no fields in dataset are mandatory even if the dataset part is mandatory, kind of weird ?
    - -> inference schema deleted
    - miss one parameter to tell the length of the input/output video, audio etc in terms of seconds?
    - delete "volumeUnit" and tell in the description of the field "volume" that it should be given in Go, it will allow to simplify the comparison between reports.
    - delete field "items" because we can already find it in the shape
    - change shape from array to string to simplify data entry
    - useless to have several inferenceProperties because only one measure related, you might as well fill it in just once, taking the average number of tokens generated, etc. so removed the table
    - inferenceProperties: put directly inside dataset
- environment: Make this section optional as the real need is energy consumption to be able to perform comparison between configuration, if the person is not interested in transforming the value into carbon footprint, it is not a problem
- measure:
    - delete "serverSideInference" because we only want measure from server side ? describe this in the readme
    - delete unit and force kWh by default

### Minor Changes
- header:
    - change mandatory fields from "formatVersion", "reportId", "reportStatus" to "reportDatetime" only to simplify
- algorithm:
    - gives more example in algorithmName to tell this is the place to name the llm
    - maybe put foundation model and then algorithm to better describe finetuning ? in this case algorithm name must be optional
    - maybe add number parameters of the model ?
    - change "quantization" from number to string
- dataset:
    - remove "volume" of the mandatory fields because if you are working with text inference, you will fill the number of tokens so you don't know and need the volume of data
    - change volume type from integer to number to be able to put floats

- environment:
    - add of location's description because the difference with country was not clear
- infrastructure:
    - service instead of instance ? or both asked ?
