# Examples

We provide you with few examples to understand how to create a report by following the schema correctly. 
The script validate-schema.py allows you to check that your report follows the format correctly, and if it doesn't, it details the errors so that you can easily correct them.

To use it, you need to have Python installed, as well as the modules described in the requirements.txt document.

Then, you just need to run : python validate-schema.py <json-report-name>

For example :  python validate-schema.py ./energy-report-example-1.json
